/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

const gitDefinition = "Git is an open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows."


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

const gitHubDefinition = "GitHub is a distributed version-control platform where users can collaborate on or adopt open source code projects, fork code, share ideas and more."

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

const gitInitDefinition = "The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project."

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.
*/

const gitCloneDefinition = "git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine accessible supported protocols. The git clone command copies an existing Git repository."

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitStatusDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git status' does.
*/

const gitStatusDefinition = "The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history."

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

const gitAddDefinition = "Git add is the first command in a chain of operations that directs Git to save a snapshot of the current project state, into the commit history. When used on its own, git add will promote pending changes from the working directory to the staging area."

const gitAddCode = "git add --all"
//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".
*/

const gitCommitDefinition ""


//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitPushDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git push' does.
